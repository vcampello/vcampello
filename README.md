# Hey, it's-a me, VC!

Senior Backend Engineer building insurance tech

## What I'm working on

Currently building event-driven systems that process telematics data to help drivers get tailored insurance.

## Current stack

- TypeScript
- AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB, SQS/SNS, API Gateway, CDK)
- Go occasionally
- ~Way too much time in~ Datadog dashboards

## Things I care about

- **Developer experience**: life's too short for poor tools and bad CI/CD pipelines
- **YAGNI (you ain't gonna need it)**: write the basic implementation first. Don't abstract before you need it (but don't ignore it either)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: if you're going to deploy then it needs to be reproducible
- **Learning**: there are too many cool things out there

## Random facts

- Ride my CBR600F when the weather cooperates
- Gaming when the weather does not cooperate
- Learning all of the time
- I maintain my entire dev environment in a dotfiles repo (I'm too attached to my tools)
- Always learning something new (currently Rust, but ask me again in 3 months)
